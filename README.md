# Association-Rule-Mining-in-Text-Naive-Bayes-and-Market-Basket-Analysis-for-Fake-News-Detection








This project integrates Naïve Bayes and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) for fake news detection. Naïve Bayes is used for text preprocessing—tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal—to identify key terms. MBA then uncovers word associations based on support, confidence, and lift, enhancing text mining and pattern discovery.
