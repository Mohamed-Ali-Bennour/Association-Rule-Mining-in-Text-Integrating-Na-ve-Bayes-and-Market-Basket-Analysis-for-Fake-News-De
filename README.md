# Text Mining with Naïve Bayes and Market Basket Analysis for Fake News Detection

This project integrates Naïve Bayes and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) for fake news detection. Naïve Bayes is used for text preprocessing—tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal—to identify key terms. MBA then uncovers word associations based on support, confidence, and lift, enhancing text mining and pattern discovery.
The project uses two datasets:
- **Fake News Dataset**: Contains fake news articles labeled as fake.
- **True News Dataset**: Contains true news articles labeled as true.
