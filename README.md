# Text Mining with Naïve Bayes and Market Basket Analysis for Fake News Detection

This project integrates Naïve Bayes and Market Basket Analysis (MBA) for fake news detection. Naïve Bayes is used for text preprocessing—tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stop-word removal—to identify key terms. MBA then uncovers word associations based on support, confidence, and lift, enhancing text mining and pattern discovery.
